                  Extensions to DNSSD Discovery Proxy
                        draft-sctl-hybrid-bis-00

Abstract

   This document extends the Multicast Service Discovery Proxy
   specification by defining a mode of service advertising where the
   service proactively registers itself with the network rather than
   having to be discovered.

1.  Introduction

   The Multicast Service Discovery Proxy [I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid]
   specification defines a mechanism for discovering services on a
   subnetted network using Multicast DNS (mDNS) [RFC6762], through the
   use of Discovery Proxies, which issue mDNS requests on various links
   in the network on behalf of a host attempting service discovery.

   This document extends the Multicast Service Discovery Proxy in
   several ways:

   o  Provide a mechanism whereby a DNSSD service can advertise services
      proactively, instead of requiring that a service be discovered.

   o  Provide a means whereby such a service can claim ownership of a
      particular service name for a period of time, without that service
      necessarily being advertised as available.

   o  Provide a means whereby such a service can have its information
      published by the Query Proxy even when it is not sensitive to
      network requests.

   o  Provide a means of waking up such a service when a request is
      made, using a 'wake-on-lan packet'.

   o  Act as a bonjour sleep proxy, making this service available to
      existing hosts that support sleep proxy [SLEEP].

2.  Operation Types

   [Is this already in a document somewhere, e.g.  RFC 6763?]

   Bonjour [ref] originally provided three primitives:

   register  advertise a service

   browse  discover services

   resolve  get IP address and port for a service

   We clarify this as follows: Offer, Enumerate, Use.

   Offer  A server indicates what service type it provides, under what
      instance name.  [what do these look like?]

   Enumerate  A potential client requests a list of available instances
      for a specified desired service type.  [what do these look like?]

   Use  Having picked a particular instance to use, a client then wants
      to use it.  The relevant difference here is we are talking in
      terms of a connect-by-name style of API.  Whereas "resolve"
      reveals IP addresses to client software, the "use" API takes a
      named instance as input, and returns a connection to that service.
      Client software does not need to get involved with IP addresses,
      Happy Eyeballs, etc.  [what do these look like?]

   [What about the other primitives implied by list in intro?]
