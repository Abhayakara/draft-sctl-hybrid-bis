                  Extensions to DNSSD Discovery Proxy
                        draft-sctl-hybrid-bis-00

Abstract

   This document extends the Multicast Service Discovery Proxy
   specification by splitting the Discovery Proxy into two seperable
   modules, one of which is lightweight and stateless, while the other
   manages all necessary state and need not be present on every link.
   This document additionally defines a mode of service advertising
   where the service proactively registers itself with the network
   rather than having to be discovered.

1.  Introduction

   The Multicast Service Discovery Proxy [I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid]
   specification defines a mechanism for discovering services on a
   subnetted network using mDNS, through the use of Discovery Proxies,
   which issue mDNS requests on various links in the network on behalf
   of a host attempting service discovery.

   This document extends the Multicast Service Discovery Proxy in
   several ways:

   o  Split the Discovery Proxy into two separable modules:

      Query Proxy  which is a stateful proxy that answers queries from
         clients and issues queries to Relay Proxies.  Any DNSSD
         installation must have at least one Query Proxy.

      Relay Proxy  which is a stateless proxy that asks questions posed
         by Query Proxies on a link and returns responses to such
         questions to the Query Proxy.  Exactly one query proxy is
         required for each link on which service discovery will be
         supported.

   o  Provide a mechanism whereby a DNSSD service can advertise services
      proactively, instead of requiring that a service be discovered.

   o  Provide a means whereby such a service can claim ownership of a
      particular service name for a period of time, without that service
      necessarily being advertised as available.

   o  Provide a means whereby such a service can have its information
      published by the Query Proxy even when it is not sensitive to
      network requests.

   o  Provide a means of waking up such a service when a request is
      made, using a 'wake-on-lan packet'.

   o  Act as a bonjour sleep proxy, making this service available to
      existing hosts that support sleep proxy [SLEEP].

2.  Query Types

   [Is this already in a document somewhere, e.g.  RFC 6763?]

   Bonjour [ref] originally provided three primitives:

   register  advertise a service

   browse  discover services

   resolve  get IP address and port for a service

   We clarify this as follows: Offer, Enumerate, Use.

   Offer  A server indicates what service type it provides, under what
      instance name.  [what do these look like?]

   Enumerate  A potential client requests a list of available instances
      for a specified desired service type.  [what do these look like?]

   Use  Having picked a particular instance to use, a client then wants
      to use it.  The relevant difference here is we are talking in
      terms of a connect-by-name style of API.  Whereas "resolve"
      reveals IP addresses to client software, the "use" API takes a
      named instance as input, and returns a connection to that service.
      Client software does not need to get involved with IP addresses,
      Happy Eyeballs, etc.  [what do these look like?]

   [What about the other primitives implied by list in intro?]

3.  Query Proxy

   The Query proxy performs queries on behalf of hosts.  Hosts can both
   enumerate and use services.  When a host asks to enumerate a service,
   the Query Proxy will query Relay Proxies on every local link to
   provide a set of answers to the host.  When a host asks to use a
   service, the Query Proxy will issue its query only on the link on
   which that service is known to exist. [what if it's been forgotten?]

   The Query Proxy also receives sleep proxy requests and service
   announcements that are relayed by Relay Proxies. [hm]

   The Query Proxy maintains a cache which contains:

   o  proactive registrations from services on local links

   o  cached results of previous queries that have not yet timed out

   o  sleep proxy registrations

   All responses from relay proxies are cached for a period of
   'INTERVAL' or the TTL of the response, whichever is shorter [?].

   When a host has requested DNS push, or has issued a "use" query, any
   answers available in the cache are returned immediately.  If a host
   requests enumeration of a service type, and does not request DNS
   push, the Query Proxy waits for 'INTERVAL' and then composes an
   answer using whatever information is present in the cache, which will
   include any answers that have come in from the relay proxy during the
   wait.

   The Query Proxy performs data translation, as described in Multicast
   Service Discovery Hybrid section 5.5 [I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid].

4.  Relay Proxy

   Relay proxies are essentially stateless, although they must be
   configured with the IP Address of a Query Proxy to which bonjour
   sleep proxy requests and mDNS service announcements [term?] can be
   sent.

   Relay proxies listen for DNS queries as in section 4.2 of [RFC1034].
   Queries are tagged with EDNS0 option 'TBD' to indicate the set of
   links on which the query is to be relayed. [this is an open item,
   could also use different ports, or derive link name from query and
   send a query for every link, but this requires proxies to know link
   names.]

   The Relay Proxy retransmits any question received from the Query
   Proxy on the specified link or links using Multicast DNS [RFC6762].
   Responses to the question are then forwarded back to the Query Proxy,
   tagged with the link through which the response was received using
   EDNS0 option 'TBD'.  [or port, or link name, see previous paragraph.]

   The Query Proxy MUST enable DNS Push.  The Hybrid Proxy returns
   answers using the DNS Push session in which the question was asked.

   Questions asked outside of a DNS Push session are answered with a
   result code of REFUSED.
