              A Split Model for Multicast Discovery Proxy
                       draft-sctl-hybrid-split-00

Abstract

   This document extends the Multicast Service Discovery Proxy
   specification by splitting the Discovery Proxy into two seperable
   modules, one of which is lightweight and stateless, while the other
   manages all necessary state and need not be present on every link.

1.  Introduction

   The Multicast Service Discovery Proxy [I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid]
   specification defines a mechanism for discovering services on a
   subnetted network using Multicast DNS (mDNS) [RFC6762], through the
   use of Discovery Proxies, which issue mDNS requests on various links
   in the network on behalf of a host attempting service discovery.

   The original Discovery Proxy is specified as a single service,
   instances of which are present on every link in a particular network.
   When a client wishes to enumerate all services of a particular type,
   it first queries for a list of "browsing domains," and then queries
   for the particular service it wants, asking the same question in each
   of the browsing domains.

   In practice, for a host that is relying on a caching resolver, this
   means that a sequence of queries will arrive at the caching resolver,
   all nearly identical, one for each of the the set of browsing
   domains, of which there will be one per link.  Each of the browsing
   domains has to be at least notionally a separate zone, because each
   domain is served by a different server.

   Some of the practical implications of this are that each hybrid proxy
   has to have a complete configuration that allows it to do data
   translation (see Multicast Service Discovery Proxy
   [I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid] section 5.5).  The local caching resolver
   must support DNS Push, or that functionality is lost.  Supporting DNS
   push in a general-purpose caching resolver adds complexity that in
   most cases is not needed.

   This document proposes a new architecture in which the Discovery
   Proxy is simplified, and the caching server takes over part of the

   work of the Discovery Proxy, and is customized to suit the specific
   needs of multi-link service discovery.  The Discovery Proxy is split
   into two separable modules:

   Query Proxy  which is a stateful proxy that answers queries from
      clients and issues queries to Relay Proxies.  Any DNSSD
      installation must have at least one Query Proxy.

   Relay Proxy  which is a stateless proxy that asks questions posed by
      Query Proxies on a link and returns responses to such questions to
      the Query Proxy.  Exactly one query proxy is required for each
      link on which service discovery will be supported.

2.  Query Proxy

   The Query proxy performs queries on behalf of hosts.  Hosts can both
   enumerate and use services.  When a host asks to enumerate a service,
   the Query Proxy will query Relay Proxies on every local link to
   provide a set of answers to the host.  When a host asks to use a
   service, the Query Proxy will issue its query only on the link on
   which that service is known to exist. [what if it's been forgotten?]

   The Query Proxy also receives sleep proxy requests and service
   announcements that are relayed by Relay Proxies. [hm]

   The Query Proxy maintains a cache which contains:

   o  proactive registrations from services on local links

   o  cached results of previous queries that have not yet timed out

   o  sleep proxy registrations

   All responses from relay proxies are cached for a period of
   'INTERVAL' or the TTL of the response, whichever is shorter [?].

   When a host has requested DNS push, or has issued a "use" query, any
   answers available in the cache are returned immediately.  If a host
   requests enumeration of a service type, and does not request DNS
   push, the Query Proxy waits for 'INTERVAL' and then composes an
   answer using whatever information is present in the cache, which will
   include any answers that have come in from the relay proxy during the
   wait.

   The Query Proxy performs data translation, as described in Multicast
   Service Discovery Hybrid section 5.5 [I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid].

Internet-Draft            Discovery Proxy Split               April 2017


2.1.  Query Proxy Listener Configuration

   The Query Proxy may be implemented as a standalone DNS server that is
   authoritative for the local zones, or may be embedded in a DNS Proxy
   [RFC5625] or caching resolver.  How this is done depends on the
   context in which the Query Proxy is being used: in a campus network
   with knowledgable operators, it may make sense for the Query Proxy to
   be a simple authoritative server answering queries on port 53.

   In a homenet [RFC7368], it may be necessary to have a dedicated DNS
   resolver or proxy co-located in the same homenet router as the Query
   Proxy.  In this case, the two services will have to share port 53, or
   else the Query Proxy will have to listen on a dedicated IP address.
   The caching resolver or proxy will have to know to direct queries for
   local domains to the query proxy, and not to the ISP-provided caching
   resolver or to authoritative servers on the Internet.

   If the local domains exist in the global namespace, no special
   configuration is required beyond what is described in DNS Service
   Discovery [RFC6763].  However, in some environments, for example the
   homenet environment, the local domains are in non-unique, locally-
   served namespaces.  These cannot be delegated in the global DNS,
   which means that hosts that are to access services enumerated in
   these zones must use a resolver that answers with the locally-served
   names.

   It may also be the case that even though the local domains exist in
   the global namespace, the Query Proxy is configured not to answer
   queries from outside of the campus network, so that if a caching
   resolver off of the campus network is queried, no services can be
   discovered.

   Consequently, hosts that intend to discover services must use the
   resolver that is offered by the local network, e.g. with DHCPv4
   [RFC2132], DHCPv6 [RFC3646] or through the RDNSS option [RFC6106]
   delivered in a router advertisement [RFC4861].  Hosts that override
   the locally-provided DNS caching resolver risk being unable to
   discover services on the local network.

2.2.  Authoritative Service

   The Query Proxy is functionally an authoritative server for all local
   zones.  It may or may not provide the full services of a local
   authoritative server.  For example, an authoritative server for a
   zone is expected to provide an SOA record for the zone and to provide
   a strictly increasing serial number [RFC1982] which increases each
   time the content of the zone changes.  Query Proxies may or may not
   provide such a service.

Internet-Draft            Discovery Proxy Split               April 2017


   Authoritative servers also generally provide notify and zone transfer
   service for secondary DNS servers.  Such services allow for secondary
   DNS service to be provided.  However, secondary service requires that
   the zone contents be completely known; the Multicast Discovery Proxy
   does not know the full set of names in a zone, so if secondary
   service were provided, the contents of the zone would be incomplete,
   and service discovery could not succeed through the secondary server.

   An additional characteristic of authoritative servers is that it is
   expected to be the case a caching resolver may cache the content of
   that record for the duration of its TTL and respond directly to a
   query for it without consulting the authoritative server.  Similarly,
   an NXDOMAIN may be cached for some period of time, typically the TTL
   of the zone.  This is discussed in section 5.5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid].

2.3.  Multicast Resolution Process

   The Query Proxy maintains a cache of answers that it has received
   from services on the local network.  This cache is updated whenever
   new data is received from the network.  Cache entries have lifetimes
   as specified in the TTLs of the answers that are received for mDNS
   queries done on local links: when a new entry is added to the cache,
   it is marked for expiration at the current time plus the TTL [refresh
   time?].  At expiration, the entry is removed from the cache.

   When a host asks a question, the Query Proxy begins a Multicast
   Resolution process for that question. ...

   The question is then answered out of the cache.  If the host requests
   DNS Push service [I-D.ietf-dnssd-push], answers are provided
   immediately for any information that is already in the cache; as new
   entries are added to the cache, these entries are pushed to the
   client as long as the DNS push session for that query remains valid.

   If a host did not request DNS push, the Query Proxy sets a timer for
   QUERYWAIT seconds and awaits results from the multicast resolution
   process.  When the timer has expired, the Query Proxy answers the
   question using whatever information is available in the cache at that
   time.

3.  Relay Proxy

   Relay proxies are essentially stateless, although they must be
   configured with the IP Address of a Query Proxy to which bonjour
   sleep proxy requests and mDNS service announcements [term?] can be
   sent.

   Relay proxies listen for DNS queries as in section 4.2 of [RFC1034].
   Queries are tagged with EDNS0 option 'TBD' to indicate the set of
   links on which the query is to be relayed. [this is an open item,
   could also use different ports, or derive link name from query and
   send a query for every link, but this requires proxies to know link
   names.]

   The Relay Proxy retransmits any question received from the Query
   Proxy on the specified link or links using Multicast DNS [RFC6762].
   Responses to the question are then forwarded back to the Query Proxy,
   tagged with the link through which the response was received using
   EDNS0 option 'TBD'.  [or port, or link name, see previous paragraph.]

   The Query Proxy MUST enable DNS Push.  The Hybrid Proxy returns
   answers using the DNS Push session in which the question was asked.
   Questions asked outside of a DNS Push session are answered with a
   result code of REFUSED.
