              A Split Model for Multicast Discovery Proxy
                       draft-sctl-hybrid-split-00

Abstract

   This document extends the Multicast Service Discovery Proxy
   specification by splitting the Discovery Proxy into two seperable
   modules, one of which is lightweight and stateless, while the other
   manages all necessary state and need not be present on every link.

1.  Introduction

   The Multicast Service Discovery Proxy [I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid]
   specification defines a mechanism for discovering services on a
   subnetted network using Multicast DNS (mDNS) [RFC6762], through the
   use of Discovery Proxies, which issue mDNS requests on various links
   in the network on behalf of a host attempting service discovery.

   The original Discovery Proxy is specified as a single service,
   instances of which are present on every link in a particular network.
   When a client wishes to enumerate all services of a particular type,
   it first queries for a list of "browsing domains," and then queries
   for the particular service it wants, asking the same question in each
   of the browsing domains.

   In practice, for a host that is relying on a caching resolver, this
   means that a sequence of queries will arrive at the caching resolver,
   all nearly identical, one for each of the the set of browsing
   domains, of which there will be one per link.  Each of the browsing
   domains has to be at least notionally a separate zone, because each
   domain is served by a different server.

   Some of the practical implications of this are that each hybrid proxy
   has to have a complete configuration that allows it to do data
   translation (see Multicast Service Discovery Proxy
   [I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid] section 5.5).  The local caching resolver
   must support DNS Push, or that functionality is lost.  Supporting DNS
   push in a general-purpose caching resolver adds complexity that in
   most cases is not needed.

   This document proposes a new architecture in which the Discovery
   Proxy is simplified, and the caching server takes over part of the
   work of the Discovery Proxy, and is customized to suit the specific
   needs of multi-link service discovery.  The Discovery Proxy is split
   into two separable modules:

   Query Proxy  which is a stateful proxy that answers queries from
      clients and issues queries to Relay Proxies.  Any DNSSD
      installation must have at least one Query Proxy.

   Relay Proxy  which is a stateless proxy that asks questions posed by
      Query Proxies on a link and returns responses to such questions to
      the Query Proxy.  Exactly one query proxy is required for each
      link on which service discovery will be supported.

2.  Query Proxy

   The Query proxy performs queries on behalf of hosts.  Hosts can both
   enumerate and use services.  When a host asks to enumerate a service,
   the Query Proxy will query Relay Proxies on every local link to
   provide a set of answers to the host.  When a host asks to use a
   service, the Query Proxy will issue its query only on the link on
   which that service is known to exist. [what if it's been forgotten?]

   The Query Proxy also receives sleep proxy requests and service
   announcements that are relayed by Relay Proxies. [hm]

   The Query Proxy maintains a cache which contains:

   o  proactive registrations from services on local links

   o  cached results of previous queries that have not yet timed out

   o  sleep proxy registrations

   All responses from relay proxies are cached for a period of
   'INTERVAL' or the TTL of the response, whichever is shorter [?].

   When a host has requested DNS push, or has issued a "use" query, any
   answers available in the cache are returned immediately.  If a host
   requests enumeration of a service type, and does not request DNS
   push, the Query Proxy waits for 'INTERVAL' and then composes an
   answer using whatever information is present in the cache, which will
   include any answers that have come in from the relay proxy during the
   wait.

   The Query Proxy performs data translation, as described in Multicast
   Service Discovery Hybrid section 5.5 [I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid].

3.  Relay Proxy

   Relay proxies are essentially stateless, although they must be
   configured with the IP Address of a Query Proxy to which bonjour

   sleep proxy requests and mDNS service announcements [term?] can be
   sent.

   Relay proxies listen for DNS queries as in section 4.2 of [RFC1034].
   Queries are tagged with EDNS0 option 'TBD' to indicate the set of
   links on which the query is to be relayed. [this is an open item,
   could also use different ports, or derive link name from query and
   send a query for every link, but this requires proxies to know link
   names.]

   The Relay Proxy retransmits any question received from the Query
   Proxy on the specified link or links using Multicast DNS [RFC6762].
   Responses to the question are then forwarded back to the Query Proxy,
   tagged with the link through which the response was received using
   EDNS0 option 'TBD'.  [or port, or link name, see previous paragraph.]

   The Query Proxy MUST enable DNS Push.  The Hybrid Proxy returns
   answers using the DNS Push session in which the question was asked.
   Questions asked outside of a DNS Push session are answered with a
   result code of REFUSED.
