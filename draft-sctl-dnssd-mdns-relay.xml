    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
	The Discovery Proxy for Multicast DNS-Based Service Discovery
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid"/>
	is a mechanism for discovering
	services on a subnetted network through the use of Discovery Proxies,
	which issue Multicast DNS (mDNS) requests <xref target="RFC6762"/>
	on various multicast links in the network on behalf of a remote host
	performing DNS-Based Service Discovery <xref target="RFC6763"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        In the original Discovery Proxy specification, it is assumed that for every multicast link on
        which services will be discovered, a host will be present running a full Discovery
	Proxy.  This document introduces a lightweight Discovery Relay which can be used
	to provide discovery services on a multicast link without requiring a full Discovery Proxy
	on every multicast link.
      </t>
      <t>
	The Discovery Relay operates by listening for TCP connections from Discovery Proxies.
	When a Discovery Proxy connects, the connection is authenticated and secured using TLS.
	The Discovery Proxy can then specify one or more multicast links from which it wishes to receive mDNS traffic.
	The Discovery Proxy can also send messages to be transmitted on its behalf on one or more of those multicast links.
	DNS Stateful Operations (DSO) <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-session-signal"/> is used as
	a framework for conveying interface and IP header information associated with each message.
      </t>
      <t>
	The Discovery Relay functions essentially as a set of one or more remote virtual interfaces for the
	Discovery proxy, one on each multicast link to which the Discovery Relay is connected.  In a complex
	network, it is possible that more than one Discovery Relay will be connected to the same
	multicast link; in this case, the Discovery Proxy ideally should only be using one such Relay
	Proxy per multicast link, since using more than one will generate duplicate traffic.
      </t>
      <t>
	How such duplication is detected and avoided is out of scope for this document: in
	principle it could be detected using HNCP <xref target="RFC7788"/> or configured using
	some sort of orchestration software in conjunction with NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/>
	or CPE WAN Management Protocol <xref target="TR-069"/>.

	The following definitions may be of use:
	<list style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="mDNS Agent">
	    A host which sends and/or responds to mDNS queries.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Discovery Proxy">
	    A network service which receives well-formed questions using the DNS protocol,
	    performs multicast DNS queries to answer those questions, and responds with those
	    answers using the DNS protocol.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="Discovery Relay">
	    A network service which relays received mDNS messages to a Discovery Proxy,

	  <t hangText="multicast link">
	    A maximal set of network connection points, such that any host connected to any
	    connection point in the set may send a packet with a link-local multicast destination address
	    (specifically the mDNS link-local multicast destination address <xref target="RFC6762"/>)
	    that will be received by all hosts connected to all other connection points in the set.
	    Note that it is becoming increasingly common for a multicast link
	    to be smaller than its corresponding unicast link.
	    For example it is becoming common to have
	    multiple Wi-Fi Access Points on a shared Ethernet backbone, where the
	    multiple Wi-Fi Access Points and their shared Ethernet backbone form a single unicast link
	    (a single IPv4 subnet, or single IPv6 prefix) but not a single multicast link.
	    Unicast packets between two hosts on that IPv4 subnet or IPv6 prefix are correctly delivered,
	    but multicast packets are not forwarded between the various Wi-Fi Access Points.
	    Given the slowness of Wi-Fi multicast, the decision to not forward multicast packets
	    between Wi-Fi Access Points is reasonable, and that further supports the need for technologies
	    like Discovery Proxy and Discovery Relay to facilitate discovery on these networks.

	    that sent it.  The service receiving the message may log the event, and may also

    <section anchor="overview" title="Protocol Overview">
      <t>
	This document describes a way for Discovery Proxies to communicate with mDNS agents on
	remote multicast links to which they are not directly connected, using a Discovery Relay.
	As such, there are two parts to the protocol:
	connections between Discovery Proxies and Discovery Relays,
	and communications between Discovery Relays and mDNS agents.
      </t>

      <section anchor="tcpov" title="Connections between Proxies and Relays (overview)">
	<t>
	  Discovery Relays listen for incoming connection requests.  Connections between Discovery Proxies and
	  Discovery Relays are established by Discovery Proxies. Connections are authenticated
	  and encrypted using TLS, with both client and server certificates.  Connections are
	  long-lived: a Discovery Proxy is expected to send many queries over a single
	  connection, and Discovery Relays will forward all mDNS traffic from subscribed
	  interfaces over the connection.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The stream encapsulated in TLS will carry DNS frames as in the DNS TCP protocol
	  <xref target="RFC1035"/> Section 4.2.2.  However, all messages will be DSO
	  messages <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-session-signal"/>.  There will be
	  three types of such messages:
	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>Control messages from Discovery Proxy to Discovery Relay</t>
	    <t>mDNS messages from Discovery Relay to Discovery Proxy</t>
	    <t>mDNS messages from Discovery Proxy to Discovery Relay</t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  Subscribe messages from the Discovery Proxy to the Discovery Relay indicate to the
	  Discovery Relay that mDNS messages from one or more specified multicast links are to be
	  relayed to the Discovery Proxy.
	</t>
	<t>
	  mDNS messages from a Discovery Proxy to a Discovery Relay cause the Discovery Relay
	  to transmit the mDNS message on one or more multicast links to which the Discovery Relay
	  host is directly attached.
	</t>
	<t>
	  mDNS messages from a Discovery Relay to a Discovery Proxy are sent whenever an
	  mDNS message is received on a multicast link to which the Discovery Relay has subscribed.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Discovery Relays are responsible for keeping connections alive when no traffic has
	  been sent during a keepalive period (See <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-session-signal"/>
	  Section 4).
	</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="mdnsov" title="mDNS Messages On Multicast Links">
	<t>
	  Discovery Relays listen for mDNS traffic on all configured multicast links that have at least
	  one active subscription from a Discovery Proxy. When an mDNS message
	  is received on a multicast link, it is forwarded on every open Discovery Proxy connection that
	  is subscribed to mDNS traffic on that multicast link.  In the event of congestion, where a
	  particular Discovery Proxy connection has no buffer space for an mDNS message that
	  would otherwise be forwarded to it, the mDNS message is not forwarded to it.
	  Normal mDNS retry behavior is used to recover from this sort of packet loss.
	  Discovery Relays are not expected to buffer more than a few mDNS packets.
	  Excess mDNS packets are silently discarded.
	  In reality this is expected to be a nonissue.
	  Particularly on networks like Wi-Fi, multicast packets are transmitted
	  at rates ten or even a hundred times slower than unicast packets.
	  This means that even at peak multicast packets rates, it is likely that
	  a unicast TCP connection will able to carry those packets with ease.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Discovery Proxies send mDNS messages they wish to have sent on their behalf
	  on remote multicast link(s) on which the Discovery Proxy has an active subscription.
	  A Discovery Relay will not transmit mDNS packets on any multicast link on which
	  the remote Discovery Proxy does not have an active subscription,
	  since it makes no sense for a Discovery Proxy to ask to have a query
	  sent on its behalf if it's not able to receive the responses to that query.
	</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="tlsconn" title="Connections between Proxies and Relays (details)">
      <t>
	When a Discovery Relay starts, it opens a passive TCP listener to receive incoming connection requests
	from Discovery Proxies.  This listener may be bound to one or more source IP addresses,
	or to the wildcard address, depending on the implementation.  When a connection is
	received, the relay must first validate that it is a connection to an IP address to
	which connections are allowed.  For example, it may be that only connections to ULAs
	are allowed, or to the IP addresses configured on certain interfaces.  If the listener
	is bound to a specific IP address, this check is unnecessary.
      </t>
      <t>
	The relay must then validate that the source IP address of the connection is on its
	whitelist.  If the connection is not permitted either because of the source address or
	the destination address, the Discovery Relay responds to the TLS Client Hello message
	from the Discovery Proxy with a TLS user_canceled alert
	(<xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-tls13"/> Section 6.1).
      </t>
      <t>
	Otherwise, the Discovery Relay will attempt to complete a TLS handshake with the
	Discovery Proxy.  Discovery Proxies are required to send the post_handshake_auth
	extension (<xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-tls13"/> Section 4.2.5).  If a relay proxy
	receives a ClientHello message with no post_handshake_auth extension, the Discovery
	Relay rejects the connection with a certificate_required alert (<xref
	target="I-D.ietf-tls-tls13"/> Section 6.2).
      </t>
      <t>
	Once the TLS handshake is complete, the Discovery Relay MUST request post-handshake
	authentication as described in (<xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-tls13"/> Section 4.6.2).  If
	the Discovery Proxy refuses to send a certificate, or the key presented does not match
	the key associated with the IP address from which the connection originated, or the
	CertificateVerify does not validate, the connection is dropped with the TLS
	access_denied alert (<xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-tls13"/> Section 6.2).
      </t>
      <t>
	Once the connection is established and authenticated, it is treated as a DNS TCP
	connection <xref target="RFC1035"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	Aliveness of connections between Discovery Proxies and Relays is maintained as described
	in Section 4 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-session-signal"/>.  Discovery Proxies must
	also honor the 'Retry Delay' TLV (section 5 of
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-session-signal"/>) if sent by the Discovery Relay.
      </t>
      <t>
	Discovery Proxies may establish more than one connection to a specific Discovery Relay.
	This would happen in the case that a TCP connection stalls, and the Discovery Proxy is
	able to reconnect before the previous connection has timed out.  It could also happen as
	a result of a server restart.  It is not likely that two active connections from the
	same Discovery Proxy would be present at the same time, but it must be possible for
	additional connections to be established.  The Discovery Relay may drop the old
	connection when the new one has been fully established, including a successful TLS
	handshake.  What it means for two connections to be from the same Discovery Proxy is
	that the connections both have source addresses that belong to the same proxy, and that
	they were authenticated using the same client certificate.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Traffic from Relays to Proxies">
      <t>
	The mere act of connecting to a Discovery Relay does not result in any mDNS traffic
	being forwarded.  In order to request that mDNS traffic from a particular multicast link be
	forwarded on a particular connection, the Discovery Proxy must send one or more DSO
	messages containing mDNS a Link Request TLV (<xref target="mDNSlinkrq"/>)
	indicating the multicast link from which traffic is requested.
      </t>
      <t>
	When such a message is received, the Discovery Relay validates that the specified multicast link
	is available for forwarding, and that forwarding is enabled for that multicast link.  For each
	such message the Discovery Relay validates the multicast link specified and includes in a single
	response RCODE 0 if the multicast link specified is valid, or RCODE 11 (DSOFAIL) otherwise.
	For each valid multicast link, it begins forwarding
	all mDNS traffic from that link to the Discovery Proxy.  Delivery is not guaranteed: if
	there is no buffer space, packets will be dropped.  It is expected that regular mDNS
	retry processing will take care of retransmission of lost packets.  The amount of buffer
	space is implementation dependent, but generally should not be more than the bandwidth
	delay product of the TCP connection <xref target="RFC1323"/>.
	The Discovery Relay should use the TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT mechanism
	<xref target="NOTSENT"/><xref target="PRIO"/> or equivalent,
	to avoid building up a backlog of data in excess of the amount necessary
	to have in flight to fill the bandwidth delay product of the TCP connection.
      </t>
      <t>
	mDNS messages from Relays to Proxies are framed within DSO messages.
	Each DSO message can contain multiple TLVs,
	but only a single mDNS message is conveyed per DSO message.
	Each forwarded mDNS message is contained in
	an mDNS Message TLV (<xref target="mDNSmessage"/>).  The layer two source address of the
	message, if known, MAY be encoded in a Layer Two Source TLV (<xref target="l2sa"/>).  The
	source IP address and port of the message MUST be encoded in a IP Source (<xref
	target="ipsrc"/>).  The multicast link on which the message was received MUST be
	encoded in a Link Identifier TLV (<xref target="linkid"/>).  The Discovery Proxy MUST
	silently ignore unrecognized TLVs in mDNS messages, and MUST NOT discard mDNS messages
	that include unrecognized TLVs.
      </t>
      <t>
	A Discovery Proxy may discontinue listening for mDNS messages on a particular multicast link by
	sending a DSO message containing an mDNS Link Discontinue TLV (<xref
	target="mDNSdis"/>).  Subsequent messages from that link that had previously been queued
	may arrive after listening has been discontinued.  The Discovery Proxy should silently
	ignore such messages.  The Discovery Relay MUST discontinue generating such messages as
	soon as the request is received.  The Discovery Relay does not respond to this message
	other than to discontinue forwarding mDNS messages from the specified links.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Traffic from Proxies to Relays">
      <t>
	Like mDNS traffic from relays, each mDNS message sent by a Discovery Proxy to a
	Discovery Relay is encapsulated in an mDNS Message TLV (<xref target="mDNSmessage"/>)
	within a DSO message.  Each message MUST contain one or more Link
	Identifier TLVs (<xref target="linkid"/>).  The Discovery Relay will transmit the
	message to the mDNS port and multicast address on each link specified in the message
	using the specified IP address family.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Discovery Proxy Behavior">
      <t>
	Discovery Proxies treat multicast links for which Discovery Relay service is being used as if they
	were virtual interfaces; in other words, a Discovery Proxy serving multiple multicast links using
	multiple Discovery Relays behaves the same as a Discovery Proxy serving multiple multicast links
	using multiple physical network interfaces.  In this section we refer to multicast links served
	directly by the Discovery Proxy as locally-connected links, and multicast links served through the
	Discovery Relay as relay-connected links.
      </t>
      <t>
	What this means is that when a Discovery Proxy receives a DNSSD query from a client, it will generate
	mDNS messages on the relevant multicast link for which it is acting as a proxy.  For locally-connected
	links, those messages will be sent directly.  For relay-connected links, the messages
	will be sent through the Discovery Relay that is being used to serve that multicast link.
      </t>
      <t>
	Responses from devices on locally-connected links are processed normally.  Responses
	from devices on relay-connected links are received by the Discovery Relay, encapsulated,
	and forwarded to the Discovery Proxy; the discovery proxy then processes these messages
	using the link-identifying information included in encapsulation.
      </t>
      <t>
	Discovery Proxies do not respond to mDNS queries on relay-connected links.  If an mDNS
	query is received from a Discovery Relay, the Discovery Proxy silently discards it.
      </t>
      <t>
	In principle it could be the case that some device is capable of performing service
	discovery using mDNS, but not using the DNS protocol.  Responding to mDNS queries received
	from the Discovery Relay could address this use case.  However, it is believed that no
	such devices exist, and therefore the preferred behavior is that all queries be resolved
	with unicast rather than multicast.

    <section anchor="prov" title="Provisioning">
      <t>
	In order for a Discovery Proxy to use Discovery Relays, it must be configured with
	sufficient information to identify multicast links on which service discovery is to be supported
	and connect to discovery relays supporting those multicast links, if it is not running on a host
	that is directly connected to those multicast links.
      </t>
      <t>
	A Discovery Relay must be configured both with a set of multicast links to which the host on which
	it is running is connected, on which mDNS relay service is to be provided, and also with
	a list of one or more Discovery Proxies authorized to use it.
      </t>
      <t>
	On a network supporting DNS Service Discovery using Discovery Relays, more than one
	different Discovery Relay implementation is likely be present.  While it may be that
	only a single Discovery Proxy is present, that implementation will need to be able to be
	configured to interoperate with all of the Discovery Relays that are present.
	Consequently, it is necessary that a standard set of configuration parameters be defined
	for both Discovery Proxies and Discovery Relays.
      </t>
      <t>
	DNS Service Discovery generally operates within a constrained set of links, not across
	the entire internet.  This section assumes that what will be configured will be a
	limited set of links operated by a single entity or small set of cooperating entities,
	among which services present on each link should be available to users on that link and
	every other link.  This could be, for example, a home network, a small office network,
	or even a network covering an entire building or small set of buildings.  The set of
	Discovery Proxies and Discovery Relays within such a network will be referred to in this
	section as a 'Discovery Domain'.
      </t>
      <t>
	Depending on the context, several different candidates for configuration of Discovery
	Proxies and Discovery relays may be applicable.  The simplest such mechanism is a
	configuration file, but regardless of provisioning mechanism, certain configuration
	information needs to be communicated to the devices, as outlined below.

	<section title="Multicast Link">
	  <t>
	    The description of a multicast link consists of:
	    <list style="hanging">
	      <t hangText="link-identifier">
		An 32-bit identifier that uniquely identifies that link within the Discovery
		Domain.  Each link MUST have exactly one such identifier.  Link Identifiers do
		not have any special semantics, and are not intended to be human-readable.
	      </t>
	      <t hangText="ldh-name">
		A fully-qualified domain name for the multicast link that is used to form an LDH domain name as described
		in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid"/>, section 5.3.
		This name is used to identify the link during provisioning, and must be present.
	      </t>
	      <t hangText="hr-name">
		A human-readable user-friendly fully-qualified domain name for the multicast link.
		This name MUST be unique within the Discovery Domain.
		Each multicast link MUST have exactly one such name.
		The hr-name MAY be the same as the ldh-name.
		(The hr-name is allowed to contain spaces, punctuation and rich text, but it is not required to do so.)
	      </t>
	    </list>
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The ldh-name and hr-name can be used to form the LDH and human-readable
	    domain names as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid"/>, section 5.3.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Note that the ldh-name and hr-name can be used in two different ways.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    On a small home network with little or no human administrative configuration,
	    link names may be directly visible to the user.
	    For example, a search in 'home.arpa' on a small home network may
	    discover services on both ethernet.home.arpa and wi-fi.home.arpa.
	    In the case of a home user who has
	    one Ethernet-connected printer and one Wi-Fi-connected printer,
	    discovering that they have one printer on
	    ethernet.home.arpa and another on wi-fi.home.arpa
	    is understandable and meaningful.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    On a large corporate network with hundreds of Wi-Fi Access Points,
	    the individual link names of the hundreds of multicast links
	    are less likely to be useful to end users.
	    In these cases, Discovery Broker functionality <xref target="I-D.sctl-discovery-broker"/>
	    is used to translate the many link names to something more meaningful to users.
	    For example, in a building with 50 Wi-Fi Access Points, each with their
	    own link names, services on all the different physical links may be
	    presented to the user as appearing in 'headquarters.example.com'.
	    In this case, the individual link names can be thought of similar to
	    MAC addresses or IPv6 addresses. They are used internally by the software
	    as unique identifiers, but generally are not exposed to end users.

	<section title="Discovery Relay">
	  <t>
	    The description of a Discovery Relay consists of:

	      <t hangText="name">
		a required machine-readable identifier used to reference the relay
	      </t>
	      <t hangText="hr-name">
		an optional human-readable name which can appear in provisioning, monitoring and
		debugging systems.  Must be unique within a Discovery Domain.
	      </t>
	      <t hangText="public-key">
		a public key that identifies the Discovery Relay. This key can be shared across
		services on the Discovery Relay Host.  Indeed, if a Discovery Proxy and Discovery
		Relay are running on the same host, the same key may be used for both.  The public
		key uniquely identifies the Discovery Relay and is used by the Discovery Proxy
		to verify that it is talking to the intended Discovery Relay after a TLS connection
		has been established.
	      </t>
	      <t hangText="private-key">
		the private key corresponding to the public key.
	      </t>
	      <t hangText="connect-tuples">
		a list of IP address/port tuples that may be used to connect to the Discovery
		Relay.  The relay may be configured to listen on all addresses on a single port,
		but this is not required, so the port as well as the address must be specified.
	      </t>
	      <t hangText="multicast links">
		a list of multicast links to which this relay is physically connected.
	      </t>
	    </list>
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The private key should never be distributed to other hosts; all of the other
	    information describing a Discovery Relay can be safely shared with Discovery
	    Proxies.
	  </t>

      </section>
      <section title="Configuration Files">
	<t>
	  For this discussion, we assume the simplest possible means of configuring Discovery
	  Proxies and Discovery Relays: the configuration file.  Any environment where changes
	  will happen on a regular basis will either require some automatic means of generating
	  these configuration files as the network topology changes, or will need to use a more
	  automatic method for configuration, such as HNCP.
	</t>
	<t>
	  There are many different ways to organize configuration files.  This discussion
	  assumes that multicast links, relays and proxies will be specified as objects, as described
	  above, perhaps in a master file, and then the specific configuration of each proxy
	  or relay will reference the set of objects in the master file, referencing objects
	  by name.  This approach is not required, but is simply shown as an example.
	  In addition, the private keys for each relay and proxy must appear only in that
	  relay or proxy's configuration file.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The master file contains a list of Discovery Relays, Discovery Proxies and Multicast Links.
	  Each object has a name and all the other data associated with it.  We do not formally
	  specify the format of the file, but it might look something like this:

      </section>
      <section title="Discovery Proxy Configuration">
	<t>
	  The Discovery Proxy configuration contains enough information to identify which
	  Discovery Proxy is being configured, enumerate the list of multicast links it is intended to serve,
	  and provide keying information it can use to authenticate to Discovery Relays.  It
	  may also contain custom information about the port and/or IP address(es) on which it
	  will respond to DNS queries.
	</t>
	<t>
	  An example configuration, following the convention used in this section, might look
	  something like this:
